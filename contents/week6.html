            <tr>
              <td style="text-align: left;">
                Write each use story in a piece of paper (e.g. yellow sticky note, index card, or just pieces of paper about
                the size of a playing card). Alternatively you can use an online tool such as Trello for recording the
                initial collection of user stories.<br><br>

              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          Note that you should not 'evaluate' the value of user stories while doing the above. An important aspect
          of brainstorming is not judging the ideas generated.

          <p>
            Next, prioritize the user stories. Suggested workflow:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Take one use story at a time and get team member opinions about it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Yes - You would like to do implement this story before the end of the semester.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maybe - It is something nice to have, but you may not have time to do it.
              </li>
              <li>
                No - It is not something you want to have in your product. Write the reason for rejection in the back of
                the paper.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories
              are in the three piles and share that information with all team members.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Here are some tips to improve the effectiveness of the above activity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Define Jim:</b><br>
              Decide our target user Jim's work patterns. e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer
              with others? (answer: no). Having a clear picture of Jim's work patterns will help when deciding the
              importance of a user story.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Don't be biased by the implementation plans:</b><br>
              This exercise is for identifying user needs. Clear your mind of ideas you have about what your product will
              look like. Assume that you don't know what product you will built yet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</b><br>
              At this point, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it.
              Implementation details can be discussed later. If a user story in the Yes pile turn out to be too difficult
              to implement later, you can always not implement it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</b><br>
              Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for some potential users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Don't go into too much details when sorting user stories:</b><br>
              For example, consider this user story:<br>
              <em>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay
                attention to them first.</em><br>
              When discussing this user story, you do not need to worry about what tasks should be considered 'needs my
              attention most at the present time'. Those details can be worked out later.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <div>
        Give this problem a try (at least some thoughts) before coming to the lecture. We are going to do it as an exercise during the lecture (30 minutes).
        <br>
        <br>
        Imagine you are building an online system called <b>TeamFormer</b>. TeamFormer is a system for helping CS2103 students during team forming period. It lets students record who is in which team.
        Students can use the system to find teams short of members and students looking for teams, easing the team forming process.
        Note that the system is not meant as a platform for students to communicate with each other to find team members.
        Students are supposed to talk to each other and form teams outside the system, as they do now.
        TeamFormer simply helps students to see the team forming status of the class (e.g., who has teams and who don’t) and record their own team after forming a team.
        It is also meant to ease the team-forming-related workload of instructors.
        <br>
        <br>
        What should be the following elements of TeamFormer requirements?
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vision: {A short statement describing the product’s objective/direction}
          </li>
          <li>
            User types/roles: Students, Instructors, {any other user types?}
          </li>
          <li>
            High-level workflow: {In the process of team forming, who will do what first, and what will happen next, and so on? Where does TeamFormer fits into this workflow?}
          </li>
          <li>
            Scope: {What will TeamFormer do, and more importantly, what team-forming-related things it will NOT do?}
          </li>
        </ul>
        Specify important requirements of TeamFormer as a list of User Stories.
        <br>
        Write one use case (i.e., textual form) for one of the user stories that you think will result in the most complex user interaction.
        <br>
        Sketch a UI for TeamFormer.
